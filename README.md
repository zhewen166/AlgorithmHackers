#Introduction
-------------
This repository is used by ISCAS14 only to practise algorithms from Leetcode; under each directory there will be a set of personal solutions to all the same set of problems and the solutions under leetcode will be the ones that are either classic or well-tuned or well-coded.

#Attention
----------
* All the arrangements will be updated before 21:30 in each monday and the corresponding personal solutions for that week will be handed in by the end of 24:00 in friday - at which point I will tag the repository and any further submissions will be ignored until next week.

* All personal resources should be placed in your own private folder, please always remember that before pushing a request - because if you are trying to contaminate the environment, your request will be removed!

* If you would like to have some sub-folders, please always stick it in mind that too deep path might destroy others' patience; so you'd better only use two-level folders at most.
